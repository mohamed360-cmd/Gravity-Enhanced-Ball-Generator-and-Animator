## Introduction

This program creates an interactive animation of bouncing balls on a canvas. The animation includes realistic physics, such as gravity and rebounding from the edges of the canvas. Users can also interact with the balls by moving the cursor near them, causing the balls to change size and creating connecting lines.

## Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the animation.

## Usage

- The program allows you to set the number of balls to be generated. The default value is 50, but you can change it.
- Click the "Generate" button to generate the specified number of balls.
- Interact with the balls by moving your cursor close to them to see them change size and draw lines connecting them.

## Features

- Adjustable number of balls: Change the number of balls to be generated within a specified limit.
- Realistic physics: Balls follow the laws of physics, including gravity and bouncing off the canvas edges.
- Interactive cursor: Moving your cursor close to the balls causes them to respond and change size.
- Colorful balls: The balls come in various colors to make the animation visually appealing.
